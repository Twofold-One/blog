Example of blockquotes:

> Markdown is a good thing for content.

Here's the example of Go code in snippet:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```

Here is the example of JavaScript in snippet:

```js
const classicGreeting = "Hello world!";

console.log(classicGreeting);
```

Try to put a blank line before...
